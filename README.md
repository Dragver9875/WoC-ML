Winter of Code Report (Machine Learning):-


Week 1 was spent in reading about the regression models, (linear, polynomial and logistic) and understanding the underlying mathematics of them. I referred to the course offered by Andrew Ng as well as the article links provided on the Cyber-Labs GitHub page.

Week 2 was spent in coding the regression models and training them on datasets from kaggle and monitoring their performance.

I suffered a bit of a setback in week 2 as I was infected with conjunctivitis for nearly 5 days and was unable to work on my laptop for more than an hour a day, thus I was a bit behind schedule on the day of mid-evaluation.

The datasets were provided on 18th December 2024. I spent the next day 19th December 2024 training the regression models on the provided datasets.

Till 20th December 2024, I was working on the regression models with separate weight and bias terms. I was then struck with the idea to add the bias term into the weights by considering the coefficient of the bias term as x⁰ and adding a column of ones into the variable array. Thus, I quickly recoded the regression models as per the new algorithm and presented it in the mid-evaluation. I had an appointment with the doctor afterwards and was unable to work further on my project that day.

The week 3 was spent working on unsupervised learning and studying about the K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbours algorithms, from Andrew Ng’s course and the articles available on the GitHub page. 

I faced some issues in this. The first issue I faced was the varying cost function graph of K-means clustering. Each time I ran the function to plot a graph of cost function vs iterations to determine the optimum number of clusters by using Elbow method, but every time, the graph values kept on changing. Thus after running the algorithm over the dataset for nearly 10 times, I chose the most optimum value of k=4.

The rest of the time was spent studying about neural networks and implementing them. It took me a lot of time understanding about it and thus I saved it for the end.
